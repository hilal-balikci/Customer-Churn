# Customer-Churn

The customer churn prediction has increased its importance, particularly in recent years, as consumers behave more consciously and the competition between companies has risen. The customer churn prediction is commonly used in fields like insurance, banking and telecommunications, and it predicts customers who are about to leave before the customer terminates their membership. With this method, companies try to convince customers who buy to leave with new offers. There are two simple approaches for the companies to handle the customer churn.

In customer churn prediction, customers who tend to leave in the future are tried to be predicted by using the data of old customers. It is ensured that cost-effective ways are selected in marketing strategies by determining the customers who will leave. In case of wrong prediction, customers who will not leave can be given a discount and in this case, it will return to the company as a loss of money.
